### Resume AI

Resume AI is a platform that transforms any résumé into a fully interactive AI version of yourself. Upload your resume, and the system automatically parses your experience, skills, education, and achievements—then builds a personalized AI assistant that represents your professional background.


Key Features
- Upload your résumé (PDF, DOCX, or text)
- Automatic parsing of skills, experience, education, and achievements
- AI persona generation that reflects your tone, expertise, and career focus
- Public shareable link: rai-builder.vercel.app/[identifier]
- Interactive Q&A about your background
- Interview prep, summaries, and tailored responses based on your résumé

### Why It Exists
Traditional résumés are static. Resume AI makes them dynamic. Instead of reading a document, people can talk to your experience getting instant answers, insights, and context that a resume alone can’t provide.
